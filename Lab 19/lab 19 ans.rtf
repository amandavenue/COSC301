\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. Which subnet does host 192.168.77.108/28 belong to?\
\
	192.168.77.96/28\
\
2. What valid host range is the IP address 172.21.71.219/20 part of?\
\
	172.21.64.1 -> 172.21.255.254\
\
3. What is the first valid host on the subnetwork that the node 172.16.139.35/26 belongs to?\
\
	172.16.139.1\
\
4. What is the broadcast address of the network 172.30.134.0/23?\
\
	172.30.135.255\
\
5. How many subnets and hosts can you get from the network 172.20.0.0/255.255.254.0?\
\
	it is /23 -> don\'92t know how to work this out though. Class B?\
	subnet = 2^7\
	hosts = 2^9 -2\
\
6. Given the following address allocations, create two further allocations, a /29 (\'93Test network\'94) and a /27 (\'93Sensor network\'94), such that the fragmentation of the address space in minimalist. The \'93Test network\'94 can be a subset of the Engineering subnet.\
\
	test network = 172.16.20.64/29\
	senior network = 172.16.20.32/27}
